## Czyzew Recrutation Project

### Prepare environment
Please, execute `prepare_environment.sh` script to setup and install all project requirements.
The script will install (if not already installed) `python-pip` and `virtualenv` packages on your system (works for Debian-based distros only!).
When script is finished you will be prompted with message:
```
Now run
  > source bin/activate
```
So be so kind and execute in your shell `source bin/activate` to start working with our project.
